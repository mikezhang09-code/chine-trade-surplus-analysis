The Great Divergence: Anatomy of China’s Structural Trade Surplus in the Era of Geoeconomic Fragmentation (2025-2026)
Executive Assessment: The $1.2 Trillion Paradox
In the annals of modern economic history, the year 2025 will likely be recorded as a point of rupture—a moment when the gravitational laws of global trade appeared to invert. Against a backdrop of intensifying geopolitical hostility, a resurgent trade war led by the "Trump 2.0" administration in the United States, and a synchronized erection of tariff barriers across the European Union and the Global South, the People's Republic of China did not retreat. Instead, it posted a trade surplus of approximately $1.189 trillion, the largest external imbalance ever recorded by a single nation-state.   

This figure is staggering in its magnitude. To provide context, the surplus alone is roughly equivalent to the entire Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Saudi Arabia, or the combined economic output of the Netherlands and Switzerland. It represents approximately 10% of China's own GDP, a ratio of external imbalance that far exceeds the historical peaks of other export superpowers such as Japan in the early 1990s or Germany following the Eurozone debt crisis.   

The central inquiry of this report is to dismantle the mechanics of this surplus. Conventional economic intuition suggests that rising tariffs and a hostile external environment should compress a nation’s trade balance. That China has achieved the opposite result suggests that the drivers of this surplus are not merely cyclical, but deeply structural. The phenomenon is the result of a collision between two powerful tectonic forces: the hyper-competitiveness of a supply-side industrial base that has successfully pivoted to high-technology manufacturing (the "New Three"), and a chronic, structural deficiency in domestic demand that has severely compressed imports.   

This report argues that the 2025 surplus is not a sign of economic health in the traditional sense, but rather a symptom of "involution"—a fierce internal competition within China that has driven producer prices into deflationary territory, forcing firms to export their excess capacity to survive. Furthermore, the resilience of these exports in the face of U.S. tariffs reveals a fundamental reshaping of global supply chains, where the Global South—particularly ASEAN and Latin America—has replaced the West as the primary engine of China’s external demand, serving both as a final market and a transshipment hub.   

Section I: The Macroeconomic Engine of Disequilibrium
To understand why Chinese ships are leaving ports fully laden while returning relatively light, one must look inward at the structural distortions of the Chinese economy. The surplus is an accounting identity: it is the difference between what a country produces and what it consumes. In 2025, China produced at record levels while its consumption remained structurally repressed.

1.1 The Scars of the Property Crisis and the "Negative Wealth Effect"
The foundation of the 2025 surplus was laid years prior, with the slow-motion collapse of the Chinese real estate market beginning in 2021. For decades, real estate served as the primary store of household wealth in China. The evaporation of property values has triggered a profound "negative wealth effect," leading Chinese households to aggressively increase savings and curtail discretionary spending.   

This contraction in domestic consumption has a direct impact on the trade balance by suppressing imports. In 2025, while exports surged by 6.6% in December alone, full-year import growth was flat (0.0%), reflecting a deep reluctance among Chinese consumers and businesses to purchase foreign goods. This dynamic creates a "recessionary surplus"—a trade balance that expands not because the world is buying significantly more, but because China is buying significantly less.   

Table 1: The Divergence of Trade Flows (2025 Performance)

Trade Metric	Performance (YoY)	Economic Driver
Total Exports	+5.5% (Full Year)	Supply-side stimulus, deflationary pricing, market diversification
Total Imports	0.0% (Full Year)	Weak domestic demand, property crisis, import substitution
Export Value (Dec)	+6.6%	Front-loading before new tariffs, resilience of "New Three"
Import Value (Dec)	+5.7%	Minor recovery due to strategic stockpiling (commodities)

1.2 "Involution" and the Deflationary Export Subsidy
A critical, often overlooked driver of the surplus is the phenomenon of industrial "involution" (neijuan). Following the real estate peak, investment capital that previously flowed into property development was redirected by state policy into the industrial sector. Between 2021 and 2022, industrial assets in high-growth sectors grew by 32%.   

This massive misallocation of capital created significant overcapacity. By late 2025, China had experienced 38 consecutive months of negative producer price inflation (PPI). Facing a saturated domestic market where prices are falling, Chinese firms have no choice but to export.   

This deflation acts as a de facto export subsidy. Because Chinese goods are becoming cheaper in real terms due to domestic hyper-competition, they remain attractive to global buyers even when slapped with foreign tariffs. For example, if a U.S. tariff raises the price of a Chinese widget by 20%, but the Chinese producer price drops by 15% due to domestic deflation and efficiency gains, the net price increase to the American consumer is negligible. This mechanism explains why U.S. tariffs have failed to crush export volumes—Chinese deflation is absorbing the blow.   

1.3 The Profitability Crisis in High-Tech Manufacturing
The data reveals a stark paradox: the sectors driving the export boom are often the least profitable. In the high-growth sectors championed by the "Made in China 2025" initiative—such as EVs, batteries, and solar—nearly 34% of firms were operating at a loss in 2025.   

This indicates that the trade surplus is being fueled by "zombie lending" and state-directed credit that keeps unprofitable factories running to maintain employment. These firms must export at marginal cost (or below) to generate cash flow, flooding global markets with underpriced high-tech goods. This structural overcapacity is the root cause of the trade tensions with the EU and the U.S., as Western firms cannot compete with Chinese entities that are indifferent to profit maximization.   

Section II: The "New Three" – Technocratic Industrial Policy in Action
The composition of China’s exports has undergone a metamorphosis. The "Old Three" (clothing, furniture, appliances) have been superseded by the "New Three" (electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries, and solar cells). In 2023-2024, exports of the New Three surged 30%, accounting for a significant portion of GDP growth. By 2025, these sectors had become the tip of the spear in China's trade offensive.   

2.1 Electric Vehicles: The Global Blitzkrieg
China exported over 7 million automobiles in 2025, a 21% increase year-on-year, cementing its status as the world’s largest auto exporter for the third consecutive year. This success is built on a decade of industrial policy that created a vertically integrated supply chain that Western automakers cannot match on cost.   

However, the 2025 export surge was also a desperate escape from the "blood ocean" of the Chinese domestic market. With domestic EV adoption exceeding 50%, price wars decimated margins for companies like BYD and SAIC. In response, they pivoted aggressively abroad.   

The European Theater: Despite the EU imposing countervailing duties of up to 45% in late 2024, Chinese EVs captured a record 12.8% market share in Europe in November 2025. Chinese firms absorbed the tariffs or utilized their massive cost advantages—often 30% lower than European equivalents—to remain competitive.   

The Hybrid Strategy: A notable shift in 2025 was the surge in Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) exports to Europe, which rose six-fold. This reflects an adaptation to European consumer range anxiety and a tactical move to target segments where European manufacturers are weaker.   

2.2 Solar Photovoltaics: The Limits of Volume
The solar sector illustrates the dangers of unchecked capacity expansion. In 2025, Chinese solar module exports reached record volumes (46 GW in August alone), yet the value of these exports barely rose due to a collapse in unit prices. Prices for solar modules fell to $0.07-0.09 per watt, levels that rendered production unprofitable for many players.   

Recognizing that it was effectively subsidizing the rest of the world’s energy transition at the expense of its own financial health, Beijing intervened. In late 2025, the government canceled the 13% VAT export rebate for solar modules and batteries. This move was designed to force a consolidation of the industry, eliminate weak players, and raise global prices. Analysts project a 9% increase in solar module prices in Q4 2025 as a result. This marks a significant pivot from "market share at all costs" to "margin recovery."   

2.3 Batteries: The Indispensable Link
China controls approximately 69% of the global EV battery market as of 2025. This dominance makes it virtually impossible for global automakers to decouple completely. Even as the U.S. and EU attempt to build "battery belts," they remain dependent on Chinese refined lithium, cathode materials, and manufacturing equipment. In 2025, battery exports grew 23%, driven largely by demand from emerging markets in ASEAN and Africa, which are leapfrogging internal combustion engines.   

Section III: The Unsung Heavyweights – Construction Machinery and Petrochemicals
While the "New Three" garner headlines, massive structural shifts in traditional industrial sectors have quietly fortified the trade surplus.

3.1 The Battle for Earth: SANY vs. Caterpillar
The construction machinery sector is a microcosm of the broader Chinese economy. With the domestic property market in a coma, demand for excavators and cranes within China collapsed. In response, Chinese champions like SANY Heavy Industry and XCMG unleashed a global export offensive.

In the first half of 2025, SANY’s international revenue accounted for 60.3% of its total, rising nearly 12% year-on-year. This is a historic reversal for a company that was once almost entirely domestic-focused.   

Market Share Shift: SANY has solidified its position as the 3rd largest heavy equipment manufacturer globally, challenging Caterpillar and Komatsu. In 2025, SANY held a 17% global market share in excavators.   

The Belt and Road Factor: The surge in machinery exports is heavily correlated with Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) projects. Exports to Africa jumped 40.5% and to Asia-Australia by 16.3% in H1 2025. Chinese infrastructure projects abroad are built with Chinese machines, creating a closed-loop export ecosystem.   

3.2 The Petrochemical Transformation: From Buyer to Seller
Perhaps the most underreported structural shift is China’s transition from the world’s largest importer of petrochemicals to a net exporter. Between 2024 and 2025, China brought online massive capacity in ethylene and propylene production.

The Glut: In 2025, China’s ethylene surplus (capacity minus demand) reached 11.5 million tonnes, and propylene surplus hit 20.3 million tonnes.   

Global Impact: This flood of capacity has depressed global petrochemical margins, forcing closures of older plants in Europe and Asia. China is now exporting refined polymers and synthetic fibers at scale, further widening the trade surplus and reducing its import bill for energy derivatives.   

Section IV: Technological Autarky and Import Substitution
A critical component of the growing surplus is the reduction of imports through successful substitution. The "Made in China 2025" plan, while missing some targets, has succeeded in reducing China's reliance on foreign technology in key areas, thereby improving the net trade balance.

4.1 The Semiconductor Breakthroughs: Fact and Friction
The semiconductor sector remains the central battlefield of the U.S.-China tech war. Despite draconian U.S. export controls, China has made significant, albeit costly, progress in domesticating the supply chain.

The Lithography Milestone: In 2025, reports emerged that Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) had begun deploying a domestic lithography machine capable of 28nm production, and potentially prototyping 8nm capabilities using multi-patterning.   

The EUV Claim: More controversially, sources indicate that Chinese labs, leveraging former ASML talent and immense state funding, have developed a prototype Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) machine, aiming for operational chip production by 2028-2030. While mass production remains distant, the progress in legacy chips (28nm and above) has allowed China to reduce imports of foundational semiconductors used in cars and appliances, replacing them with domestic alternatives.   

4.2 Medical Devices: The Mindray Effect
The medical device sector has seen a quiet revolution. Policies mandating "local content" in hospital procurement (50% domestic targets) have propelled companies like Mindray to dominance.   

Substitution: Domestic high-end CT scanners and MRI machines are replacing imports from GE, Siemens, and Philips.

Tariff Response: Following U.S. tariffs on medical devices in April 2025, Chinese firms accelerated their push into non-U.S. markets. Mindray and others have captured market share in Latin America and Southeast Asia, offering devices at 30-40% discounts to Western competitors.   

Section V: The Geographic Pivot – Transshipment and the Global South
The U.S. market is no longer the sole determinant of China’s export health. In 2025, exports to the U.S. fell by ~20%, yet total exports rose. This decoupling was achieved through a massive geographic pivot to the Global South.

5.1 ASEAN: The "Connector" Economy
ASEAN is now China’s largest trading partner. Exports to the bloc rose 13.4% in 2025. This relationship is characterized by the "connector" model: China exports intermediate goods (batteries, textiles, chips) to Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia, where they are assembled and re-exported to the West.   

Vietnam's Role: Research indicates a near 1:1 correlation between rising Chinese exports to Vietnam and rising Vietnamese exports to the U.S., confirming Vietnam’s role as a transshipment hub to bypass tariffs.   

Local Friction: This flood of inputs is a double-edged sword. While it fuels Vietnam’s export economy, it has decimated local industries in Indonesia and Thailand. Indonesia reported mass layoffs in its textile sector due to cheap Chinese imports, leading to protectionist backlash.   

5.2 Latin America: The Strategic Backyard
China has effectively utilized Latin America as a hedge against U.S. agricultural leverage.

The Port of Chancay: The inauguration of the massive, Chinese-built Port of Chancay in Peru ($3.5 billion investment) creates a direct logistical artery between South America and Shanghai. This port reduces shipping times by weeks and bypasses U.S.-controlled trade routes.   

The Soy Swap: In response to U.S. tariff threats, China has aggressively shifted soybean purchases to Brazil. In late 2025, Chinese buyers paid a premium for Brazilian soy over U.S. soy, deliberately sidelining U.S. farmers despite "phase one" style purchase agreements. This cemented Brazil’s status as a critical strategic partner, insulated from U.S. pressure.   

5.3 Russia: The RMB Bloc
Trade with Russia continues to expand, driven by the exodus of Western firms. Chinese automakers now command the Russian market. Crucially, roughly 36% of Russian exports to China are now settled in Renminbi (RMB), advancing Beijing’s goal of creating a "sanctions-proof" trade bloc.   

Section VI: Capital Exports – The Indonesia Case Study
As barriers to goods trade rise, China is exporting capital and industrial capacity. The case of Indonesia is the most sophisticated example of this strategy.

6.1 The Danantara-GEM Nexus
In 2025, Indonesia launched its new sovereign wealth fund, Danantara, with an explicit mandate to downstream the nation's mineral wealth. China immediately engaged.

The Deal: Danantara signed a strategic agreement with Chinese battery material giant GEM to develop a massive nickel processing and recycling hub.   

Strategic Implications: This is not just investment; it is supply chain capture. By partnering with the sovereign fund, China secures long-term access to Indonesian nickel (vital for batteries) while helping Indonesia achieve its industrialization goals.

Tariff Circumvention: By processing nickel and building batteries in Indonesia (via JVs with companies like Vale and EcoPro), Chinese firms can potentially export "Indonesian" batteries to markets that might tariff "Chinese" batteries, effectively laundering the national origin of the product.   

Section VII: The Global Backlash – "Trump 2.0" and Beyond
The 2025 surplus has triggered a global protectionist response that extends far beyond Washington.

7.1 The U.S. Tariff Wall
The second Trump administration has escalated the trade war to total economic containment.

Universal Tariffs: The U.S. has threatened or implemented tariffs ranging from 10% to 60% on Chinese goods, and importantly, has suspended the de minimis loophole that allowed platforms like Shein and Temu to ship duty-free.   

Section 301 Expansion: New tariffs specifically target the "New Three," medical devices, and legacy chips. The average U.S. tariff on Chinese imports climbed to 57.6% by late 2025.   

7.2 The Global South Revolts
The most dangerous development for China is not U.S. hostility, which is priced in, but the backlash from the Global South.

Brazil: In a surprising turn, Brazil imposed tariffs on Chinese EVs and launched anti-dumping investigations into steel and fiber optics in 2025.   

Indonesia & Turkey: Both nations have imposed safeguard duties on Chinese textiles and machinery to prevent the hollowing out of their domestic industries.   

Implication: The "China Price" is becoming a political liability. China can no longer count on the Global South as a limitless sink for its excess capacity.

Section VIII: Currency Dynamics and Future Outlook
The sheer size of the surplus places immense upward pressure on the Renminbi.

8.1 The Managed Float
Market fundamentals suggest the RMB should appreciate significantly given a $1.2 trillion surplus. However, the PBOC has actively managed the currency to keep exports competitive. State banks have accumulated foreign assets to sterilize inflows, effectively putting a floor under the USD/CNY exchange rate.   

2026 Forecast: Analysts at Goldman Sachs and ING predict that this dam must eventually break, forecasting an appreciation toward 6.85-6.90 in 2026 as the current account surplus becomes too large to mask.   

8.2 The Road to 2030: Sustainability Crisis?
As China enters the 2026-2030 planning cycle, the "export-to-grow" model faces an existential crisis.

Market Saturation: The world simply cannot absorb more Chinese manufacturing. The revocation of export rebates for solar and batteries in late 2025 signals that Beijing knows the limits have been reached.   

Domestic Rebalancing: The 15th Five-Year Plan is expected to finally prioritize domestic consumption. However, without structural reforms to the social safety net and a resolution to the property crisis, household spending will remain depressed.   

Conclusion
China’s record trade surplus in 2025 is a monument to its industrial might and a warning sign of its domestic fragility. By combining state-directed investment in high-tech sectors with a deflationary internal market, China has engineered a trade dominance that has reshaped the world. Yet, this success is precarious. As the U.S. tightens its containment and the Global South begins to erect its own barriers, the "export valve" that has sustained the Chinese economy is closing. The surplus of 2025 may well represent the high-water mark of globalization before the tide of fragmentation fully recedes.
