China’s Surging Trade Surplus Amid Global Trade Tensions (2010–2025)

Summary: Despite intensifying U.S.-China trade tensions since 2018 and efforts to diversify supply chains away from China, the country’s trade surplus has expanded to record levels. China’s merchandise trade surplus – after moderating in the mid-2010s – began rising sharply in the late 2010s and accelerated through the COVID-19 pandemic. By 2022 the goods trade surplus neared $890 billion (an all-time high), and it broke the $1 trillion mark in 2025. This growth has been driven by China’s dominant manufacturing sector (especially electronics, machinery, and more recently automobiles and green technology exports) and macroeconomic factors such as a competitive currency, weak domestic demand (which suppresses imports), and state-led industrial policies. China’s surplus persisted in spite of U.S. tariffs and “decoupling” efforts – largely because Chinese exporters found new markets in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and because global supply chains remain deeply entwined with China. Below, we analyze the long-term trends (2010–2025) behind China’s record trade surplus, with a focus on developments since 2018, a breakdown by key sectors, and the macroeconomic context (exchange rate, consumption, labor, investment). Recent trade data (2022–2024) are included to illustrate these trends.

Historical Trends: 2010–2017 vs. Post-2018 Surge

In the early 2010s, China’s trade surplus as a share of GDP actually shrank compared to the mid-2000s. After peaking at over 10% of GDP in 2007, China’s current account surplus fell to near-balance (around 0.2% of GDP by 2018) as import growth and RMB appreciation reduced the imbalance. Throughout 2010–2014, rising wages and policies to boost domestic demand contributed to slower export surplus growth. By the mid-2010s, China’s goods trade surplus even saw a temporary spike (e.g. in 2015) due to a collapse in commodity import prices, but generally the surplus was not a major global concern by 2017–2018.

However, starting in 2018 – the year the U.S.-China trade war began – China’s trade surplus entered a new expansionary phase. Ironically, this occurred precisely when the U.S. was trying to reduce it. President Trump’s tariffs (first imposed in 2018) did not achieve their intended effect of shrinking the bilateral imbalance; instead, China’s overall surplus kept growing. In 2017, China’s trade surplus (goods) was about $780 billion; by 2022 it had ballooned to roughly $1.13 trillion (though official Chinese customs data put the 2022 goods surplus at about $878 billion, the largest on record in dollar terms). This doubling of the surplus in just five years was fueled by a surge in exports outpacing imports. One analysis notes that between 2017 and 2022, Chinese exports rose by over $1.1 trillion while imports increased by about $640 billion, resulting in a net $460+ billion jump in the trade surplus.

Why did the surplus surge after 2018? Two key reasons emerged:

Global Trade Diversion and “Indirect” Exports: U.S. tariffs did redirect some trade – China’s share of U.S. imports fell, and certain exports (especially tariff-targeted goods) dropped in U.S.-bound volume. But China compensated by increasing exports to other markets. Any reduction in China’s direct exports to the U.S. “has been offset by increased ‘indirect’ exports via other countries”. For example, intermediate goods shipped from China to Mexico or Vietnam are assembled into products ultimately sold to the U.S., masking China’s contribution. Moreover, China aggressively cultivated alternative markets: exports to Western Europe, other Asian countries, and even U.S. neighbors (Canada, Mexico) all climbed, more than making up for lost U.S. sales. As a result, the world became more dependent on China even as the U.S. tried to disengage, and China became slightly less dependent on the U.S. market in particular.

Pandemic-era Export Boom: The COVID-19 pandemic (2020–2021) supercharged China’s export surplus. China’s swift industrial recovery and supply capacity – coupled with worldwide demand for medical supplies, PPE, work-from-home electronics, and later consumer goods – led to record exports during the pandemic. At the same time, China’s strict domestic lockdowns and slow consumer rebound suppressed imports, further widening the gap. During 2020–2022, China’s exports of everything from masks and ventilators to laptops and appliances soared, while import spending was dampened by weak domestic demand and lower oil import volumes early in the pandemic. This “perfect storm” yielded large trade surpluses in recent years. In fact, by 2022 China’s merchandise trade surplus reached nearly $890 billion – about 3.6% of worldwide exports and 0.7% of global GDP. (Though as a share of China’s own GDP, ~5%, it was not unprecedented – similar peaks were seen in 2006–2008 and 2015 – the absolute scale in 2022 was unparalleled given China’s much larger economy today.)

(China’s merchandise trade surplus fell to ~2.7% of GDP in 2018 but nearly doubled to 5% by 2022. While still below mid-2000s peaks relative to GDP, in absolute terms the ~$890 billion surplus in 2022 was a record, reflecting China’s greatly expanded economic size.)

Sectoral Drivers of the Surplus

China’s trade surplus is overwhelmingly driven by its manufacturing exports. The country has solidified its role as the “world’s factory” across a range of industries – from low-tech goods like textiles to high-tech products like electronics and electric vehicles. Below we break down key sector contributions, including manufacturing, technology goods, and energy.

Manufacturing Dominance in Exports

Manufactured goods are at the core of China’s export machine and trade surplus. China today produces an estimated 35% of global manufacturing output (up from just 5% in 1995) and consistently accounts for around 20% (or more) of global manufacturing exports – far more than any other country. This dominance spans numerous industries and is reflected in China’s export composition:

Mechanical & Electrical Products: These have become the backbone of Chinese exports. In 2023, mechanical and electrical products (e.g. machinery, appliances, electronics) made up 58.6% of China’s total exports. Similarly, in 2025 electromechanical goods were about 60.9% of exports by value. This category includes items like electrical machinery, consumer electronics (smartphones, computers, TVs), industrial equipment, and appliances – areas where China’s economies of scale and supply chain integration give it a competitive edge. These higher-value manufactures have increasingly displaced the “cheap T-shirts and toys” of earlier years as key surplus drivers.

Capital Goods and Industrial Machinery: A notable trend since 2018 is China’s growing export of capital goods – the machines and tools that other countries use to industrialize. For example, exports of machine tools and auto parts to ASEAN (Southeast Asia) jumped by 56.1% and 22% year-on-year in the first eight months of 2025. Developing countries in ASEAN, Africa, and Latin America are building factories and infrastructure, and they increasingly buy machinery, construction equipment, and other capital goods from China. This has turned China into a supplier of the “tools of production” globally. Such exports tend to be high-value, contributing significantly to the surplus. (By contrast, advanced economies like the U.S., having deindustrialized, are less in the market for machine tools – so China’s growth here is driven by emerging markets’ needs, not just trade-war diversion.)

Automobiles: China has rapidly become a major net exporter of vehicles, adding to the manufacturing surplus. In 2010 China’s auto exports were negligible, but by 2023 China overtook Japan as the world’s largest auto exporter. Chinese automakers (e.g. BYD, Chery, Changan) and foreign JV factories in China shipped an estimated 5.26 million cars abroad in 2023, worth about $102 billion. This marked a stunning 62% increase in vehicle export volume from the prior year. A large portion are electric vehicles (EVs), where Chinese brands have cost advantages and strong global demand. (Tesla’s Shanghai-made EVs alone contributed 344,000 units to 2023 exports.) The automotive sector’s swing to surplus (China imports relatively few cars now) has provided a new pillar of export growth, especially since 2021–22, bolstering the overall trade surplus.

Traditional Labor-Intensive Goods: Sectors like textiles, apparel, furniture, footwear, and toys – the classic “low-end” Chinese exports – still exist but are a shrinking share of exports. Many of these industries saw thinner margins and some production shifted to cheaper locales in Asia. However, they still contribute to China’s surplus (China remains a top exporter of apparel, furniture, etc., often running large surpluses in these categories). Crucially, in recent years weak domestic demand in some of these traditional sectors led firms to “vent” their excess output abroad. An ECB analysis found that export growth since 2020 has been strongest in sectors where domestic sales underperformed – such as textiles, furniture, plastics, rubber, steel, and basic machinery. These sectors accounted for roughly 42% of China’s exports in 2024. In other words, when Chinese households or firms cut back on buying furniture or textiles at home, those manufacturers turned to export markets, sustaining China’s export volumes. This dynamic helped keep the overall surplus high, even as China moves up the value chain.

Technology and “New Energy” Exports

China’s push into higher-tech industries has significantly shaped its trade surplus composition in the past decade. While China still imports certain high-tech components (notably advanced semiconductors), it has become a dominant exporter of many technology products – from smartphones to solar panels. These technology exports have grown especially since 2018, partly offsetting the impact of U.S. tech sanctions.

Electronics and ICT Products: China is the world’s largest exporter of electronics and information & communication technology (ICT) products. Its exports of items like mobile phones (telecommunications equipment) and computers are massive: for instance, in recent data China’s top export categories included telephones (~$330 billion) and computers (~$177 billion) annually. Even in integrated circuits (where China imports more than it exports overall), China still exported about $140+ billion worth of chips (mostly lower-end or re-exported ones). The U.S. trade war and tech restrictions starting in 2018 did target this area – e.g. export controls on advanced semiconductors in 2022 sought to limit China’s tech prowess. However, China mitigated the impact: it reduced reliance on foreign inputs by promoting domestic tech alternatives (a key goal of Made in China 2025), and continued to export huge volumes of finished electronics to global consumers. In fact, Chinese export volumes of many tech-related goods have risen roughly in line with domestic production (up ~30% since 2022), suggesting that U.S. sanctions on specific high-end chips have not stopped China from exporting other tech products at scale. China’s competitive prices and improving quality (non-price competitiveness) also helped it keep or grow market share in electronics.

Green Technology (“New Energy Ecosystem”): A major new driver of exports – and a strategic focus for China – is clean energy technology. China has invested heavily in industries like solar photovoltaics, wind turbines, lithium-ion batteries, and electric vehicles, and it now leads the world in exporting these. Chinese commentators dub solar panels, EVs, and batteries the “new three” star export products (analogous to how textiles, toys, etc. were old pillars). In 2023, China’s exports of these three products exceeded ¥1 trillion for the first time, reaching ¥1.06 trillion (~$150 billion) for the year, a 29.9% annual increase. This includes millions of electric cars (as noted, EVs contributed strongly to auto export growth) and by volume an enormous share of the world’s solar panels and battery cells. In August 2023, China’s monthly clean technology exports hit a record $20 billion. These green-tech exports are significant for the trade surplus because they are high-value manufactured goods – far more lucrative than exporting raw materials. Chinese solar panels, for instance, have flooded global markets as countries race to install renewable energy, with Europe in 2022–2023 importing solar equipment in record quantities (much of it from China). Likewise, affordable Chinese EVs and buses are penetrating markets in Europe, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East, generating export revenue. Beijing’s strategy to lead the “new energy” revolution has thus translated into a competitive export edge. Notably, one analysis argues that China is exporting not just cheap goods, but an entire energy ecosystem – giving developing countries the solar panels, batteries, and EVs to reduce dependence on oil (and by extension, on the dollar-based, import-heavy fossil fuel system). In essence, China’s trade war with the West inadvertently showcased these offerings; sanctions on oil producers and Russia’s SWIFT exclusion made many countries keen to adopt China’s off-grid energy tech. This shift to high-tech green exports is driving a significant portion of the recent surplus growth.

Advanced Manufacturing and Self-Reliance: China’s industrial policy has emphasized moving up the value chain – producing airplanes, high-speed trains, telecom equipment (5G), machinery, and other high-tech goods domestically. As a result, imports of some high-tech or capital goods have been curbed (because China makes more at home), while exports of these goods rise. For example, China now exports commercial drones, telecom networking gear, railway equipment, and other advanced manufactures in which it was not globally dominant a decade ago. State support for strategic sectors (robotics, aerospace, biotech, etc.) aims to both replace imports and boost exports. This contributes to the surplus by narrowing the technology trade deficit. (One caveat: in truly cutting-edge areas like semiconductor lithography or aviation, China still relies on imports, but those are outweighed by other tech exports.) Overall, medium- and high-tech goods now constitute about 60% of China’s manufactured exports, underscoring how technology is at the heart of its export basket.

Energy and Commodities: The Import-Export Balance

Unlike manufacturing and tech, the energy sector is generally a drag on China’s trade balance – China must import vast quantities of fossil fuels and raw materials. However, even here there are nuances that affect the surplus:

Bulk Commodity Imports: China is the world’s largest importer of oil, gas, coal, and mineral ores. Its industrial economy and huge population demand huge inputs (iron ore for steel, copper for manufacturing, crude oil for transport and chemicals, etc.). When commodity prices spiked in 2021–2022, China’s import bill for these items jumped, which could have eroded the surplus. For instance, in 2021 Chinese imports of crude oil (by value) rose 34%, natural gas 56%, iron ore ~40%, and copper ore ~45%, largely due to higher global prices. This continued into 2022 with elevated prices amid the Ukraine war. However, China’s export surge still outpaced these import cost increases, so the net surplus grew. One report noted that from 2017 to 2022, China’s imports increased by ~$640 billion (much of that commodities), but exports increased by ~$1.1 trillion – thus exports “outweighed” the import rise. Additionally, China adjusted sources to manage costs (e.g. buying discounted oil from sanctioned Russia and Iran in yuan).

Energy Export Products: While China is a net importer of raw energy, it has become an exporter in some energy-related categories. Refined petroleum products (like gasoline, diesel) are one example: China built large refining capacity and sometimes exports surplus fuel. By late 2022 and 2023, Beijing even raised export quotas for refined fuels to help struggling refineries, resulting in spikes in fuel exports (benefiting Asia and Europe with cheaper fuel). Similarly, China exports some coal in regional markets (even as it imports higher-grade coal). However, these are relatively minor compared to imports of raw energy. More significantly, as discussed, China exports the equipment for energy: e.g. solar panels and wind turbines (making it an energy technology exporter). It also holds a tight grip on certain critical resource exports like rare earth elements used in high-tech manufacturing. In 2025, China’s exports of rare earths surged to their highest level in nearly a decade – despite China’s own quotas and curbs on some rare-earth types (used as a geopolitical lever). This indicates that even in resource trade, China can leverage its quasi-monopoly in specific minerals to run a surplus.

Food and Agriculture: China runs a deficit in agriculture (e.g. importing soybeans, grains, beef to feed its population). For instance, China is the top importer of soybeans (to feed pigs); in 2025 it imported a record volume of soybeans (mainly from Brazil). These agricultural imports subtract from the goods trade balance. However, China also exports some agricultural/seafood products (e.g. fish, vegetables) – though on net it’s an importer of food. The agricultural deficit, like the energy deficit, is far outweighed by the surplus in manufactured goods. (In services trade, China historically ran large deficits from outbound tourism, but that’s separate from goods – see Macroeconomic Factors below.)

Bottom line: China’s manufacturing surplus (in goods) is so large that it eclipses its commodities deficit. As of 2022, China’s trade surplus in manufactured products was roughly $1 trillion+, while it ran trade deficits in primary commodities (energy, raw materials) on the order of a few hundred billion. This mix hasn’t stopped the overall surplus from climbing. In fact, by importing commodities and adding value to them through manufacturing (for export), China essentially “imports cheap and exports dear.” Its terms of trade improved as it moved into higher-value exports while keeping import costs in check. For example, through the 2020–2023 period, export prices for China’s goods actually fell or remained competitive (helping volumes), whereas it benefitted from some decline in commodity prices in 2023. China’s trade patterns thus allow it to profit from value addition despite reliance on foreign raw materials.

Macroeconomic Factors Behind the Persistent Surplus

Several broader macroeconomic and policy factors have enabled China to maintain and grow its trade surplus in the face of external pressures:

Currency Policy (Exchange Rate Competitiveness): China’s management of the renminbi (RMB) has long been linked to its trade performance. In the 2000s, an undervalued yuan helped fuel export booms; in the 2010s the yuan gradually appreciated, but the government still intervened to prevent excessive strengthening. During trade war and pandemic years, the RMB weakened at opportune times, boosting export price competitiveness. For example, in 2022–2023 the RMB slid against the US dollar (partly due to Fed rate hikes and China’s easing policy), making Chinese goods cheaper abroad. In 2025, China’s monthly trade surpluses exceeded $100 billion seven times, “partially underpinned by a weakened yuan” that year. By contrast, in 2024 only one month saw a $100 billion surplus – illustrating how currency shifts can affect the surplus. Overall, Beijing’s policy has been to avoid large appreciation spikes and allow modest depreciation when needed to offset tariffs or slowing global demand. The People’s Bank of China also accumulated trillions in reserves from past surpluses, which can be used to stabilize the currency. This exchange-rate management ensured Chinese exports remained competitively priced, helping sustain export growth even when facing tariffs (which the yuan depreciation partly neutralized). Note: China did not engage in a “currency war” devaluation after 2018, but the market-driven drops in RMB value during periods of U.S. pressure certainly cushioned exporters.

Weak Domestic Consumption and Excess Capacity: A fundamental macro driver of China’s surplus is the imbalance between its output capacity and domestic consumption. China’s economy historically invested heavily and had high savings, while household consumption is a relatively low share of GDP (~38–40% in recent years). This means China often produces more than its domestic market can absorb, especially in manufactured goods. That surplus production naturally flows to exports. Since 2018, this issue became more acute: domestic demand has been sluggish – exacerbated by a protracted real estate downturn (since 2021) that hurt consumer confidence and by inadequate social safety nets prompting high saving. Chinese officials themselves acknowledge the need to boost consumption’s share of GDP (targeting ~45% by 2030, up from ~40%). Until that rebalancing happens, China’s growth model relies on selling abroad. HSBC’s chief Asia economist notes: “China’s economy remains extraordinarily competitive…reflecting gains in productivity and tech sophistication, but also weak domestic demand and attendant excess capacity.” In other words, because Chinese consumers aren’t fully soaking up domestic output, companies resort to exporting the excess. Empirical data bears this out: sectors with underperforming domestic sales have ramped up exports fastest, and overall, since the pandemic, China’s real exports have outpaced real domestic sales significantly. Louis Kuijs of S&P Ratings describes it as an “excess supply” problem: “Overall domestic demand lags supply…leading to downward pressure on prices and companies’ profits. It also causes friction internationally as many [Chinese] companies resort to exports to escape ‘involution’ (cutthroat competition) at home.”. This dynamic – soft home demand = strong exports, weak imports – has been a core macro reason the surplus persists. Notably, during 2021–2023, Chinese imports stalled even as exports rose. Factors like the housing slump cut import-intensive spending (e.g. less demand for imported consumer goods and construction materials). Meanwhile, ample industrial capacity and state investment in manufacturing meant Chinese factories could keep exporting without domestic bottlenecks. Until China decisively shifts to consumption-led growth (a long-term endeavor), this surplus-driving pattern is likely to continue.

Labor Force and Competitiveness: China’s labor dynamics have influenced its trade competitiveness. Over 2010–2020, manufacturing wages in China rose substantially, which led some observers to predict an erosion of export advantage or relocation of factories to cheaper countries. Indeed, some low-end assembly did move (to Vietnam, Bangladesh, etc.). However, China offset higher wages with productivity gains, automation, and moving up the value chain. The workforce, while aging (the population peaked around 2022), remains large (over 780 million labor force) and increasingly skilled. Coastal factories that faced wage pressures often upgraded to produce higher-value goods (electronics, machinery) or shifted simpler production inland where labor was cheaper. The result: China retained its manufacturing edge in many sectors. It also invested in robotics and AI to boost efficiency. By the late 2010s, China was exporting some labor-intensive production, but it simultaneously captured market share in more sophisticated industries – sustaining the surplus. Furthermore, China’s vast network of supplier firms and infrastructure (ports, logistics) gives it scale economies no rival has on the same scope. These advantages kept many multinational companies sourcing from China despite cost concerns, thus maintaining export volumes. Lastly, while labor costs rose, China didn’t face labor shortages that could choke output – unemployment has generally been moderate, and migrant workers continued to supply factories. In sum, labor force dynamics – rising skills and productivity – helped China compete on quality and not just low cost, ensuring its exports remained globally competitive and its trade surplus sustained.

Global Supply Chain Restructuring: The phrase “supply chain diversification” or “China+1” became common after 2018, as firms sought to reduce over-reliance on China due to tariffs and geopolitical risk. Some manufacturing shifted to ASEAN countries (Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia) or Mexico and India. However, rather than undermining China’s trade surplus, this restructuring often reconfigured trade in China’s favor: China became the upstream supplier of inputs to the very countries taking over certain assembly tasks. For example, Vietnam’s exports to the U.S. jumped as it replaced some Chinese assembly, but Vietnam imports large quantities of Chinese components and machinery. The Peterson Institute found that the decline in China’s share of U.S. manufactured goods imports (~5 percentage points drop due to tariffs) was offset by increases from Vietnam, Mexico, South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, etc., but the overall U.S. import dependence on foreign manufactures didn’t shrink. And many of those countries source intermediate goods from China. Thus, China indirectly benefits from supply chain shifts. Additionally, Chinese firms themselves have “offshored” some production: setting up factories in Southeast Asia to circumvent tariffs and be closer to local markets. This yields Chinese-owned export platforms abroad and often leads to Chinese exports of equipment and kits to those overseas plants. Another element is regional trade pacts: RCEP, launched in 2022, links China with ASEAN, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and others in a giant free trade area. This has further integrated Asian supply chains with China at the center, facilitating Chinese intermediate and capital goods exports throughout the region. The net effect is that U.S.-led decoupling has been partial – China’s overall share of global exports hit record highs in recent years, and its trade with many partners grew. For instance, ASEAN overtook the EU and U.S. to become China’s #1 trading partner; by Jan–Nov 2025, China’s exports to ASEAN were up 14.6% YoY, far outpacing export growth to the West. China’s Belt and Road Initiative also opened channels: infrastructure projects in developing countries financed by China often use Chinese steel, cement, machinery, and engineering services, effectively converting loans into export demand. All these supply-chain and trade-network shifts have cushioned China from Western tariffs and helped its surplus keep growing.

Investment Flows and Industrial Policy: China’s investment patterns at home and abroad played a role. Domestically, after 2018 China saw a redirection of capital from a flailing property sector to manufacturing and tech (as noted earlier). New bank loans to manufacturing soared from ~$60 billion in 2018 to nearly $700 billion by late 2023, often at subsidized rates to boost advanced industries. This flood of investment led to increased industrial capacity in sectors like electric vehicles, batteries, solar, and semiconductors – some now facing overcapacity. In the short term, that overcapacity means excess output chasing foreign markets, adding to exports (and causing concern in the West about cheap Chinese glut of EVs, etc.). The Chinese state also provided export tax rebates and incentives for manufacturers, though it has begun to moderate some (e.g. scrapping certain export rebates for solar panels in 2025 amid EU complaints). Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into China, particularly in high-tech sectors and automotive, brought in technology and expanded export-oriented production as well. For example, Tesla’s Gigafactory in Shanghai (100% foreign-owned) ramped up and by 2021+ was exporting cars to Europe and Asia. Even as some FDI diverted, China in 2020–2023 remained among top FDI recipients, especially in electric autos, chemicals, and electronics, which bolstered export capacity. Conversely, Chinese outward investment (and acquisitions) in technology and resources often aim to secure supply chains or open new markets, indirectly supporting exports (e.g. a Chinese-owned mine abroad ships raw materials to China, a Chinese-built railroad in Africa facilitates Chinese exports of equipment, etc.). Lastly, China’s capital account controls ensured that the trade surplus was not offset by uncontrolled financial outflows; this helped maintain a stable macro environment to keep exporting.

In sum, macroeconomic imbalances (high savings, weak consumption), a managed-competitive currency, and proactive industrial strategy all underpinned China’s ability to run persistent large trade surpluses. Whenever one prop (like U.S. market access) was shaken, domestic policies and new markets stepped in to support the export engine.

Resilience Despite Trade War and “Decoupling” Efforts

A striking aspect of this story is how China’s trade surplus not only persisted but grew in the face of concerted efforts by the U.S. (and some allies) to rebalance trade and reduce reliance on China. Key observations include:

Tariffs Didn’t Shrink the Gap: The tariffs imposed by the Trump administration from 2018 onward – which at their peak covered over $360 billion of Chinese goods with duties up to 25% – did not meaningfully reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China. By 2022, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit with China was actually larger than when Trump took office. (In 2022, U.S.-China goods trade hit a record $760.9 billion combined, reflecting robust two-way flows despite tariffs.) The Phase One trade deal in 2020, where China pledged extra purchases of U.S. exports, also fell short – China bought only ~58% of the target amount, and the bilateral deficit barely budged. Trump’s boast in Dec 2025 that tariffs halved the U.S. deficit was misleading – in reality, the U.S. deficit moved due to macro factors (like its own stimulus and savings rates), while China’s overall surplus soared at the same time. Essentially, tariffs caused trade diversion rather than destruction: China exported less directly to the U.S., but more to other countries or via intermediaries, leaving its global surplus intact. Even Chinese shipments to the U.S., though somewhat reduced, did not collapse. (Notably, by 2025 under a hypothetical renewed Trump administration, China’s exports to the U.S. were down 20% year-on-year, yet China’s worldwide exports were up and the surplus at record levels.)

“Decoupling” is Partial and Painful: The U.S. and some allies have talked of decoupling or “de-risking” from China – diversifying supply chains, restricting tech exports, and limiting Chinese access to critical technology. While there has been movement in this direction (e.g. semiconductor export bans, bans on TikTok on government devices, etc.), the economic reality is that a full decoupling is costly and slow. American and European consumers still buy vast quantities of “Made in China” goods, from electronics to furniture, because alternatives can be more expensive or capacity-constrained. For instance, even after shifting some sourcing, 34% of U.S. spending on manufactured goods in 2022 was on imports – up from 23% two decades ago (so U.S. import dependence actually increased, just with a different mix of source countries). China’s share of those imports fell, but the deficit simply shifted geographically. Europe, meanwhile, became more entangled: when Europe faced an energy crisis in 2022, it increased imports from China (e.g. Chinese fertilizers, machinery) to compensate for lost Russian trade and to fight inflation with cheaper goods. Indeed, China’s exports to the EU rose significantly during 2020–2022, contributing to a record trade surplus vis-à-vis Europe that alarmed European leaders by 2023. The EU-China goods trade gap became a point of contention at the December 2023 EU-China summit. Thus, decoupling efforts have been uneven – reducing one bilateral deficit can just enlarge another or push China to deepen trade with the Global South.

China’s Counter-Strategies: China hasn’t been passive amid trade tensions. It promoted trade with emerging markets aggressively. As noted, exports to regions like Africa (+25.8% in 2025), ASEAN (+13.4% in 2025), and Latin America all saw robust growth. By 2025, China’s exports to Africa and Latin America each reached around ¥3–4 trillion and grew ~6–7%, even as exports to the U.S. fell. This diversification cushioned the impact of lost U.S. sales. Additionally, Chinese firms found workarounds: e.g. shipping via third countries, using Hong Kong or ASEAN as intermediate hubs, and absorbing tariff costs via slight price cuts or yuan moves to stay competitive. China also retaliated carefully (tariffs on U.S. goods, an “Unreliable Entities” list, etc.), but generally kept its markets open to continue receiving needed imports (like semiconductors until banned) and to project an image of reliability to non-U.S. partners. This pragmatism helped maintain trade flows. Furthermore, China leaned into technology self-reliance in response to decoupling: massive R&D spending and subsidy support for domestic semiconductor and AI firms aim to eventually replace some imports and keep its tech export sector growing. There is evidence that Chinese non-tariff barriers (e.g. stricter customs or informal boycotts) have also been used: one study estimates these accounted for roughly half of the decline in China’s imports from the U.S. during 2018–19 – indicating China actively pared back purchases from the U.S. (e.g. switching to Brazilian soybeans, as happened). By reducing certain imports (without overt tariffs), China both retaliated and improved its trade balance.

Result – Surplus “Unscathed”: By the mid-2020s, it became clear that China’s trade surplus was not only unscathed by the trade war – it reached new heights. In 2022, China’s overall trade surplus (goods) was about $877 billion, up from ~$420 billion a decade earlier. In 2023, despite a global demand slowdown, China still managed around an $800+ billion goods surplus (exports grew 0.6% to ¥23.77 tn, imports fell 0.3% to ¥17.99 tn). And in 2025, China announced a record $1.189 trillion trade surplus – an almost inconceivable number historically, roughly equivalent to the GDP of an economy like Mexico or Indonesia. This “trade windfall” is so large that it has global financial repercussions: the surplus earnings get recycled into foreign assets (Chinese firms and banks invest overseas, buy commodities for stockpiling, etc.), influencing markets. Economists warn that such a surplus, if sustained, could fuel protectionist backlashes abroad. Indeed, officials note “rising Chinese trade surpluses could raise tensions with trade partners, especially those reliant on manufacturing exports themselves”. Trade partners worry about overcapacity in China flooding their markets (e.g. cheap EVs hurting European carmakers, as reflected in the EU’s anti-subsidy probe into Chinese EVs in 2023).

In short, China weathered the storm of tariffs and decoupling by leveraging its structural strengths – a huge, efficient manufacturing base and the flexibility to find new trade partners. U.S. actions curbed direct China–U.S. trade in some areas (for example, by 2025 China’s exports to the U.S. were sharply down year-on-year), but globally, China kept gaining market share. By 2025, economists expected China to continue gaining global export market share, in part due to Chinese firms expanding overseas production (to skirt tariffs) and strong demand for affordable Chinese electronics and machinery in a tight global economy. This resilience underscores that multilateral trade balances are determined by macroeconomic forces (savings-investment gaps) more than bilateral tariffs. The U.S. running large budget deficits, for instance, contributed to its overall trade deficit reaching a record $1.18 trillion in 2022, which China (as a major exporter) benefited from. Without a major correction in such macro factors or a drastic change in China’s own economic model, the surplus has proven difficult to rein in.

Recent Trade Data Highlights (2021–2024)

The period since 2021 provides a clear illustration of the trends discussed:

2021: A year of sharp rebound. China’s exports jumped over 25% in 2021 (post-pandemic surge), reaching $3.36 trillion, while imports rose ~18% to $2.69 trillion. The goods trade surplus for 2021 was around $670 billion. Strong global demand for goods and higher commodity prices both featured, but China’s export value grew faster than import value.

2022: China’s exports hit a record high of $3.59 trillion (up ~7% in USD terms), while imports were about $2.71 trillion, up only ~1%. The goods surplus expanded to $877.6 billion (35% larger than 2021’s, per customs data), the highest ever in absolute terms. Notably, in RMB terms the surplus was ¥5.86 trillion, +35% YoY. This occurred despite sporadic COVID lockdowns in China that year – exports remained robust, and imports were subdued by domestic economic strains. Sectorally, 2022 saw record exports of automobiles (as China began exporting EVs en masse) and record imports of commodities (oil, LNG, etc., at high prices), but the latter didn’t stop the surplus from setting a record. China’s share of global export markets climbed to ~15% in 2022, an unprecedented level for any country in modern times.

2023: A challenging external environment (war in Europe, global interest rate hikes) led to slower trade growth. China’s total goods trade by value was ¥41.76 trillion (≈ $5.8 trillion), just +0.2% from 2022. Exports were ¥23.77 trillion (+0.6%) and imports ¥17.99 trillion (−0.3%). In USD terms, China’s exports likely slightly decreased in 2023 due to currency depreciation, but the country still exported well over $3 trillion of goods. The trade surplus in 2023 (goods) in RMB was roughly ¥5.78 trillion – only marginally below 2022’s record (and actually slightly higher in constant USD if using current exchange rates). This indicates the surplus remained exceptionally high. By year-end 2023, there were signs of export momentum picking up again: Q4 2023 exports were stronger, with December 2023 hitting a record monthly export value (¥3.81 trillion). Key developments included export resilience in ASEAN and new product growth (“new energy” exports up ~30% as noted), and weak imports of consumer goods (partly due to falling import prices by 3.1% and only modest volume growth). China maintained a roughly 14% share of global exports in 2023. Importantly, 2023 saw Chinese citizens resume outbound tourism after borders reopened – this led to a surge in services imports (travel spending abroad), which widened the services trade deficit and meant China’s current account surplus was smaller than the goods surplus. But in goods, China was still the world’s #1 trading nation and #1 exporter by far.

2024 (partial trends): Data for 2024 (Q1–Q3) suggests China’s exports faced headwinds from weak global demand, but imports also remained tepid due to China’s slow domestic recovery. The full-year outcome was likely a still-large surplus (possibly somewhat below 2022–23 levels if exports dipped). However, by late 2024, policymakers introduced slight stimulus and exporters were aided by a cheaper yuan. Many international forecasts expect China to continue running large trade surpluses in the medium term, albeit not growing indefinitely if global demand softens.

2025: As a forward-looking note, by January 2026 China reported that its 2025 goods trade surplus hit a fresh record of $1.189 trillion. Exports in 2025 had grown by mid-single digits even as U.S.-bound shipments fell, thanks to booming sales to regions like Africa (+25.8% YoY) and ASEAN (+13.4%). Imports in 2025 recovered slightly but not enough to close the gap. Such numbers highlight China’s deep integration into global trade: it is capturing demand from every corner of the world.

As shown, after 2018 the surplus climbs dramatically, peaking in 2022. The small pullback in 2023 is largely due to global factors and service trade normalization, but goods surplus remains huge. China has been the world’s largest goods exporter each year from 2009 onward, and from 2017 onward it also became the largest overall trading nation (goods import + export). It has held that title for 7 consecutive years now.

Conclusion: Outlook and Implications

China’s record trade surplus is the result of long-running structural strengths – a powerhouse manufacturing sector and high global demand for its goods – reinforced by recent strategic shifts and external events. Since 2018, trade tensions and tariffs failed to dent China’s export engine, instead prompting it to pivot toward new markets and new industries (like green tech and advanced manufacturing) that have enhanced its surplus. Macro factors such as a weak domestic economy and a managed currency have further tilted the balance toward exports over imports. Even U.S.-led decoupling efforts have so far been more of a “bypass” than a break – with China’s trade ties rerouted rather than severed, and the world in many ways becoming more, not less, reliant on Chinese supply.

Looking forward, this massive surplus presents both opportunities and challenges. For China, it means continued accumulation of foreign earnings and leverage in the global economy (e.g. supply of key products, outward investment capital). It also, however, exposes China to potential backlash: as China’s surpluses stay high, other nations increasingly scrutinize its trade practices (e.g. subsidies, market access barriers) and consider protective measures. The surplus also underscores China’s internal imbalance – the need to boost domestic consumption so growth is less export-dependent. Chinese leaders recognize that reliance on external demand is a vulnerability, especially if global growth slows or protectionism rises. Plans are in place to raise household incomes and consumption over the next decade, which if successful, could reduce the surplus by increasing imports.

For the world, China’s record surplus is a double-edged sword: consumers benefit from cheaper Chinese goods, helping contain inflation, but domestic industries face fierce competitive pressure. It also means large Chinese capital outflows (the counterpart of the surplus) will continue to influence global financial markets and investment trends. In the geopolitical arena, trade imbalances between China and the West remain a point of tension, fueling arguments for “rebalancing” trade through reshoring or new trade rules.

In conclusion, China’s trade surplus from 2010 to 2025 has evolved from a shrinking issue to a resurgent, record-breaking phenomenon. The years since 2018 have been particularly telling: even amid a trade war, a pandemic, and efforts to disentangle from China, the surplus hit new highs. Key drivers have been China’s adaptability in its export portfolio (shifting to higher-tech and new markets) and structural economic factors (high production, moderate consumption, and strategic economic management). Barring a major realignment – either in China’s domestic economy or a concerted global shift – China’s status as a trade surplus titan looks set to endure, albeit under greater international scrutiny. As one analyst put it, “China’s economy remains extraordinarily competitive… The question for policymakers is how long a $19 trillion economy can keep shipping ever-cheaper goods abroad to compensate for weak home demand.” That open question will define the next chapter of China’s role in global trade.
